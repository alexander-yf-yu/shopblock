## About Filip

Filip is an exchange student from the University of Edinburgh, where he studies Computer Science and AI. He has strong frontend experience, with sufficient knowledge of database systems and the backend. Filip also has a knack for ML and working with data. Born and raised in Slovakia, he loves going to the mountains to hike and ski. In his spare time, he explores music and learns new human and programming languages.

## Filip's Strengths

- Strong attention to detail.
- Frontend development skills using a modern stack (React + Redux).
- Gets along well with others.

## Filip's Weaknesses

- Strong attention to detail. If not used at the right time it can lead to wasted time.
- Does not think well on his feet. His best ideas usually come _after_ the meeting.
- Works most effectively under a reasonable amount of time pressure â€“ too much free time and he wastes it, too little and he gets uncomfortable. The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle.
- Can get indecisive on his own. Discussing with the team helps though!
