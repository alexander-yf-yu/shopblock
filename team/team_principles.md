# Team Principles

## Communication
- All team members will communicate via a private slack channel: #team-of-six.
- CSC491 team members will coordinate tasks related to the MVP or project deliverables on another private slack channel: #team-of-three-devs
- Team members must take at most a day to respond to messages from Monday to Friday. Weekends are optional for response.
- Team members must disclose unavailabilities 2 days in advance.
- **Emergencies**: For urgent issues, we have created a Slack channel for which everyone has notifications turned on.

## Meetings
Weekly meetings will be held for all team members. 
- CSC491 members meet for a standup every Tuesday at 13:15.
  - This meeting is meant to be a short 15 minute meet going over the following questions:
    - What did you work on since the last update?
    - What do you plan to work on next?
    - Do you have any roadblocks?
    - Is there anything we need to communicate to the business side?
- All members meet for a standup every Tuesday at 13:30.
  - Developers give business-only team members relevant MVP-related updates

## Work
- Developers and Business-only team members will coordinate their work, at a discretionary level of detail. That is, developers will provide necessary updates on the progression of the MVP. All members are expected to contribute and remain updated with business operations within the project.
- All assignments must be finished early, 24 hours in advance of the due date.
- When Github Pull Requests are made, reviewers are added at the discretion of the developer.  
  - Work-in-progress PRs are also encouraged (i.e. using GitHub’s [draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) feature) to better collaborate on features. 
- Using GitHub issues
  - Create issues for mission critical problems that require everyone’s attention.
  -Haven’t agreed on specific guidelines, but will agree in the next 2 meetings examples of things that require issue creation.

## Other issues
We should empathize with each other and remember we are all working to achieve the same goal. We should strive to be quick to respond to matters that affect us and always try to act in the best interest of the project.
