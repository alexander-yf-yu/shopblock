## Use cases
A ShopBlock is a network of partnered businesses for shared loyalty points exchange. Every ShopBlock on our platform uses the same conversion rate from points to CAD. ShopBlock's MVP will support the following use cases:

1. As a business, I can create, join by invitation, or leave a ShopBlock.

2. As a business, I can give points to a customer based on the amount of CAD they spent. I can accept points from customers as a form of payment.

3. As a business, I can view the total number of points I gave to customers and received from customers, respectively, over a given time period for accounting purposes.
